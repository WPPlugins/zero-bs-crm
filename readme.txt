<blockquote>
<h2><strong>Who's already using Zero BS CRM?</strong></h2>
<p>We built this for ourselves. Then our friends. Then early adopters.</p>
<p>We're still going, but now it's good & stable.</p>
<p>Hundreds of entrepeneurs use Zero BS everyday, and we've noticed a common trend to the following use cases:</p>

<p><strong>Common users of ZBSCRM:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>eCommerce sites</strong> (We integrate with WooCommerce and PayPal)</li>
<li><strong>Agency & Freelancers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Start-up & Non-profit</strong></li>
<li><strong>Local & Small Biz</strong> (From personal trainers to yoga teams!)</li>
</ol>

<p>Because ZBS is so extendible, there are many individuals who don't fit these groups who also find innovative ways to use our CRM.</p>

= How to get started (Try out this CRM) =

From reading this, to understanding ZBS will probably take you 10 minutes. Familiar with WordPress? You'll be set up in under 5 mins.

Zero BS CRM installs in seconds, (with a super-quick welcome wizard to get you started). Adding a customer is straightforward. Creating a quote, or invoice, even simpler. Give it a go, you'll see!

###Steps to competence with ZBSCRM:
1. Install this plugin
2. Step quickly through the Welcome Wizard
3. Add your first customer

We've even made you a quick video guide on adding your first customer, if you prefer learning from screencasts:

</blockquote>

...believe us, it really is that easy. And for starters, that's all you need a CRM to be. Easy. 

Easy CRM's get used. Easy CRM's make your customer data work for you, they don't need to be super-complex. 

Need a helping hand? No worries. Just ask [here](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/zero-bs-crm)

 
<blockquote>
= Free, but supported =
<p>Did we already tell you this is free? Well it is.</p>

<p>We support ZBS, (update it, fix it, love it, refine it), because we use it ourselves everyday. ZBS is a gift back to this lovely community around WordPress, a gift to you.</p>

<p>The world is full of people seeking to take your cash, but small biz and WordPress people deserve an easier start. We give this to you because life's too short to use overcomplex expensive software from the get go. Maybe there's a time for that, we're not sure, but for most successful entrepreneurs we know, simple & practical is the winning combo.</p>

<p>So that's the story. <strong>Zero BS CRM is free. Totally.</strong> There's some extensions we sell, stuff like 'mail campaigns', but they're relatively cheap, ($27-$129, or everything for $199). We're not hoping to get mega-rich from this, we just want to build good stuff for good people, and maybe have some beers!</p>

<p>To that end we'll keep this updated, if you keep this cool. Throw us suggestions, grab an <a href="http://zerobscrm.com/extensions">extension</a>, use ZBS to make your businesses better. Tell people. We're here for win-win business :)</p>

<p>P.S. When you do need support, just use <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/zero-bs-crm">this page</a></p>

= Updates for Life = 
See at the top it says 'last updated' - I bet we updated fairly recently, eh? But guess what? We're not adding useless features to slow down your CRM. We only add much-requested simple & practical features. If anything, our updates are often refinements, improving our existing CRM functionality until it's the best it can possibly be.



<blockquote> 
= Made by Professionals = 
<p>We've been here a while. Between us we're probably accountable for a million WordPress-related downloads. We've built 50+ plugins, 10+ themes. We make our livelihoods with WordPress.</p>

<p><strong>Optional Extensions (fairly priced power-ups for your ZBS CRM)</strong></p>

<p>We've built a few super tools for Zero BS, but they're mostly outside of the original plan, so we've seperated them into individual "extensions". These all have some supercharging effect on your ZBS, but none are essential.</p>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there any limits to customer counts in ZBS? =

There are absolutely no limits in Zero BS CRM, apart from the usual ones applied by your host (database size etc.)

= Can I develop on top of ZBS? =

Of course. Please reach out to us via the in-plugin feedback page if you want to, we'll help you get started.

= Is ZBS really free? = 

Totally. The core is a solid, useful, Customer Relationship Manager right out of the box. You don't need anything else to get started managing your leads, and customers. We do build extensions, (because we need them), but they're not at all essential. Further, they're cheap in comparison to the pay-per-month CRM options, and you actually own them, yourself.

= Where can I see the CRM extensions? =
